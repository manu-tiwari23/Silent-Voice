# Silent-Voice
Silent Voice is an AI-based hand gesture recognition system that translates sign language into speech. Using 5 flex sensor readings, it predicts alphabets, forms words, and speaks valid ones using gTTS. Designed to assist non-verbal communication, itâ€™s ideal for smart gloves and real-world gesture-to-speech use.
